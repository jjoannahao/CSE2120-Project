# CSE2120-Project

Precipitate Calculator

## Data Structures, Functions Required
* tuple
* 1D array 
  * tuple crosses this off or might need another one
* 2D array
  * use where??
* dict optional
- +1 functions must 
  - add value to array 
  - modify a value in an array

## Pseudocode
inputs include:
* name of ion, volume, conc.
   * need to know charge, molar mass

processing
* determine which product is the precipitate (all formation rxns?)
* balance equation 
  * use a check to make sure net charge (of all things) is 0
* find LR
  * use volume, conc., coefficients from chem rxn
* find moles of product/precipitate
  * use LR, mole ratio (coefficients)
* find (theoretical) molar mass of precipitate
* calculate mass of precipitate w/ molar mass, moles

outputs
* mass of precipitate
